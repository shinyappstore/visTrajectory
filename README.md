# visTrajectory: Visualize latent trajectories and their uncertainties

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/visTrajectory](https://shinyappstore.com/a/visTrajectory)__

visTrajectory is a Shiny App for visualizing latent trajectories and their uncertainties in multivariate and high-dimensional datasets. It uses the Bayesian Unidimensional Scaling (BUDS) technique which extracts dominant sources of variation in high dimensional datasets and produces their visual data summaries, facilitating the exploration of a hidden continuum. The method maps multivariate data points to latent one-dimensional coordinates along their underlying trajectory, and provides estimated uncertainty bounds. By statistically modeling dissimilarities and applying a DiSTATIS registration method to their posterior samples, we are able to incorporate visualizations of uncertainties in the estimated data trajectory across different regions using confidence contours for individual data points.
